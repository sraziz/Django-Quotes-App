743,age   ,You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.,Al Pacino
744,age   ,It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood  but I'm not discouraged.,Jane Fonda

751,age   ,There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we're lifetime baby-making machines. Women's reproductive abilities start to wane when they're as young as 35. Men? We're good to go pretty much till we're dead.,Jeffrey Kluger
752,age   ,Older fatherhood isn't all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age  making them less reactive and more patient  and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who's just getting started.,Jeffrey Kluger
753,age  ,Credit or debit cards  for starters  are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money  we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it.

754,age  ,When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules  but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls  and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age.

763,age   ,I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing.,Rupert Everett
764,age   ,Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common  which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one  let me tell you.,Rupert Everett
765,age   ,I began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15 16  17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war  my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid.,Roberto Cavalli

774,age   ,I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it.

781,age   ,Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life - so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.,Jon Hamm

790,age   ,At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.,Naguib Mahfouz
791,age   ,I don't know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean  90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.,Joan Collins

795,age  ,We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids' diets from a very early age  which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters.

802,age  ,Study is the bane of childhood  the oil of youth  the indulgence of adulthood  and a restorative in old age.,Walter Savage Landor

829,age  ,I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me  and the other was the same age  and neither worked out.

830,age   ,From age 16  I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.,Gary Vaynerchuk
831,age   ,IQ is a commodity  data is a commodity. I'm far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read 'Tech Crunch ' 'Ad Age.'

836,age   ,I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can't help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it's taught writers.,David Mitchell
837,age   ,Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age  my hobby became thinking and finding connections.,Dean Kamen
838,age  ,I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can't be friend and their parent in a lot of situations  especially in this day and age where it's so dangerous for kids. So there's a bit of sternness  I guess  in the way I raise my kids.,Tim McGraw
839,age  ,In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people  but we're now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman  J. K. Rowling  Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.,David Mitchell

844,age  ,Well  once you've resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you're past the age you ever thought you would do it  you might as well do it as long as you can. As long as I can still lift a microphone  then I'll do it  you know.,Jarvis Cocker

853,age   ,Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up  we grow out of our haircuts  our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.,Patti Stanger
854,age   ,I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn't want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn't want a boss.,Barbara Corcoran
855,age  ,Regardless of age  regardless of position  regardless of the business we happen to be in  all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me  Inc.

874,age  ,Despite what anti-aging ads say  growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin  100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity  but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn't trade. Women who lie about their age - 'why?',Demi Moore

888,age  ,I'm never overawed by a situation and I think that's because I've always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29  I've always felt in control of a situation. People used to say  when you're 32  you'll look 32. I'm still waiting for that moment  where my age catches up with my appearance.,Chris O'Dowd
889,age   ,I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face.,Arthur Smith

4214,art   ,It is not hard to understand modern art. If it hangs on a wall it's a painting  and if you can walk around it it's a sculpture.,Tom Stoppard
4215,art   ,Art is anything you can get away with.,Marshall McLuhan
4216,art   ,Everything a writer learns about the art or craft of fiction takes just a little away from his need or desire to write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to say.,Raymond Chandler

4218,art   ,To say nothing  especially when speaking  is half the art of diplomacy.,Will Durant
4219,art   ,Design in art  is a recognition of the relation between various things  various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it  in the fourth dimension. That is  with your blood and your bones  as well as with your eyes.,David Herbert Lawrence
4220,art  ,Oh literature  oh the glorious Art  how it preys upon the marrow in our bones. It scoops the stuffing out of us  and chucks us aside. Alas!,David Herbert Lawrence

4224,art   ,The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art  but by no means all  seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.,Edward Hopper

4227,art  ,Music is your own experience  your own thoughts  your wisdom. If you don't live it  it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But  man  there's no boundary line to art.,Charlie Parker

4231,art   ,Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man's starving!,O. Henry
4232,art  ,It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art  or his art  or the artist part of him  than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.,Ezra Pound

4239,art   ,The art challenges the technology  and the technology inspires the art.,John Lasseter
4240,art  ,To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is  intimacy  spirituality  color  aspiration towards the infinite  expressed by every means available to the arts.,Charles Baudelaire
4241,art  ,What strikes me is the fact that in our society  art has become something which is only related to objects  and not to individuals  or to life.,Michel Foucault

4243,art  ,I'm free. I just do what I want  say what I want  say how I feel  and I don't try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don't compromise my art in any kind of way  and I think people respect that.,Erykah Badu
4244,art   ,Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I've heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast.,Jerry Saltz
4245,art  ,To engage with art  we have to be willing to be wrong  venture outside our psychic comfort zones  suspend disbelief  and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.,Jerry Saltz
4246,art   ,Summer is a great time to visit art museums  which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water  you immerse yourself in art.,Jerry Saltz
4247,art   ,I can't bear art that you can walk round and admire. A book should be either a bandit or a rebel or a man in the crowd.,David Herbert Lawrence

4249,art  ,The essential function of art is moral. But a passionate  implicit morality  not didactic. A morality which changes the blood  rather than the mind.,David Herbert Lawrence

4258,art   ,Let's talk of a system that transforms all the social organisms into a work of art  in which the entire process of work is included... something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It's a Gigantic project.,Joseph Beuys
4259,art   ,Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience.,Rebecca West
4260,art   ,History repeats itself  but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird.,Joseph Conrad
4261,art  ,One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application  because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns  and that's what we love  and that's what we get off on.,Danica McKellar
4262,art    ,A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above  and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.,Clive Bell

4265,art   ,Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science  but an art.,William Bernbach
4266,art   ,I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.',Lady Gaga

4269,art   ,So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on  the degradation of the arts will go on and if that system is to last for ever  then art is doomed  and will surely die that is to say  civilization will die.,William Morris

4281,art   ,The art world is molting - some would say melting. Galleries are closing museums are scaling back.,Jerry Saltz
4282,art  ,Almost all institutions own a lot more art than they can ever show  much of it revealing for its timeliness  genius  or sheer weirdness.,Jerry Saltz
4283,art  ,The forties  seventies  and the nineties  when money was scarce  were great periods  when the art world retracted but it was also reborn.,Jerry Saltz
4284,art   ,Robert Rauschenberg was not a giant of American art he was the giant. No American created so many aesthetic openings for so many artists.,Jerry Saltz
4285,art   ,The Met is not only the finest encyclopedic museum of art in the United States it is arguably the finest anywhere.,Jerry Saltz

4288,art   ,Art usually only makes the news in America when the subject is money.,Jerry Saltz
4289,art   ,I hate art auctions.,Jerry Saltz
4290,art  ,The price of a work of art has nothing to do with what the work of art is  can do  or is worth on an existential  alchemical level.,Jerry Saltz
4291,art  ,To me  nothing in the art world is neutral. The idea of 'disinterest' strikes me as boring  dishonest  dubious  and uninteresting.,Jerry Saltz
4292,art   ,The art world is an all-volunteer force. No one has to be here if he or she doesn't want to be  and we should be associating with anyone we want to.,Jerry Saltz
4293,art   ,Wolfgang Tillman's stunning large-scale pictures  being shown for the first time  were so offhand I failed to see them as art.,Jerry Saltz
4294,art   ,Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies  when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.,Jerry Saltz
4295,art   ,There's something pleasing about large  well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all  I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.,Jerry Saltz
4296,art   ,First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing  but except on the sunniest days  you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.,Jerry Saltz
4297,art   ,Not to say people shouldn't get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.,Jerry Saltz
4298,art  ,These days  newish art can be priced between $10 000 and $25 000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1 200  they look at me like I'm a flesh-eating virus.,Jerry Saltz
4299,art  ,In art  scandal is a false narrative  a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don't know what we're seeing  we overreact.,Jerry Saltz
4300,art ,Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world  its ayatollah  deliverer  and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk  Pop Art  Jeff Koons  Marcel Duchamp  Francis Bacon  and Catholicism.,Jerry Saltz
4301,art   ,Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There's likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam's or Hamburg's galleries.,Jerry Saltz
4302,art   ,Yes  85 percent of the art you see isn't any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.,Jerry Saltz
4303,art  ,Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity  gizmos  eating  hanging out  things that make noise - all are now the norm  often edging out much else.,Jerry Saltz
4304,art  ,Imagine it's 1981. You're an artist  in love with art  smitten with art history. You're also a woman  with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn't that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country  a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.,Jerry Saltz
4305,art   ,Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties  revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties  and then tailing off.,Jerry Saltz
4306,art  ,I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn's work. That is  I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade  Grotjahn isn't simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable  curator-approved 'isms' and twists.,Jerry Saltz
4307,art   ,It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He's the modern Giotto  someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.,Jerry Saltz
4308,art   ,The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city's magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.,Jerry Saltz
4309,art   ,Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you'll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).,Jerry Saltz
4310,art   ,My culture-deprived  aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.,Jerry Saltz
4311,art    ,I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial  and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York ' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.,Jerry Saltz
4312,art  ,Outside museums  in noisy public squares  people look at people. Inside museums  we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind  getting quiet to look at art.,Jerry Saltz
4313,art   ,It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn't own one of his paintings until 1946  when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met  principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.,Jerry Saltz
4314,art  ,All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners  the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture)  the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog  and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism  idealism  and fantasy.,Jerry Saltz
4315,art   ,Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.,Jerry Saltz
4316,art  ,Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you'll find it. It's there in paintings of photographs  photographs of advertising  sculpture with ready-made objects  videos using already-existing film.,Jerry Saltz
4317,art   ,After its hothouse incubation in the seventies  appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it's now close to aesthetic kudzu.,Jerry Saltz
4318,art   ,The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we're not pure enough  good omens appear.,Jerry Saltz
4319,art  ,Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don't seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste  momentary glitches in an artist's work  or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times  however  these problems mean there's something wrong with the art.,Jerry Saltz
4320,art   ,Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years  art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.,Jerry Saltz
4321,art  ,It's great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated  even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations  large paintings  and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.,Jerry Saltz
4322,art   ,The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer's journey  shifts the emphasis from process to product  and lacks individuality and openness. It's not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments  but it should seem alive.,Jerry Saltz
4323,art  ,It's art that pushes against psychological and social expectations  that tries to transform decay into something generative  that is replicative in a baroque way  that isn't about progress  and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - 'contain multitudes.',Jerry Saltz
4324,art   ,The last time money left the art world  intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries  and a few of them have become the best in the world.,Jerry Saltz
4325,art  ,Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it  and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that  since almost no one will be selling art  artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.,Jerry Saltz
4326,art  ,While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices  an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It's a change of mood or expectation  a desire for art to be more than showy effects  big numbers  and gamesmanship.,Jerry Saltz
4327,art   ,When money and hype recede from the art world  one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.' All this flashy 'art-fair art' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.,Jerry Saltz
4328,art  ,A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory  Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit  she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors' homes  in galleries  on the walls of auction houses  and off the walls  in museum storage.,Jerry Saltz
4329,art  ,Works of art often last forever  or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves  especially gallery exhibitions  are like flowers they bloom and then they die  then exist only as memories  or pressed in magazines and books.,Jerry Saltz
4330,art   ,If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which  for two months every other year  new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.,Jerry Saltz
4331,art   ,A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years  during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.,Jerry Saltz
4332,art  ,It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art  in the mid-eighties  I almost always dismissed it as mannered  Romantic  formulaic  conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.,Jerry Saltz
4333,art ,'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992  an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling  money was scarce  and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings  performance art  John Cage  Joseph Beuys  and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile  a new art world was coming into being.,Jerry Saltz
4334,art   ,Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses  and there are more Joneses than ever.,Jerry Saltz
4335,art   ,A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection  the bar has been set pretty low.,Jerry Saltz
4336,art  ,The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes  placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact  transform both  and create a third thing.,Jerry Saltz
4337,art  ,Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties  stays in the same handful of hotels  eats at the same no-star restaurants  and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world  but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.,Jerry Saltz
4338,art  ,Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open  tall-ceilinged  super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures  should the need arise. It has arisen.,Jerry Saltz
4339,art  ,'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era ' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane  provides moments of buzzy fun  but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters  it may be the whitest  straightest  most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.,Jerry Saltz
4340,art   ,Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.,Jerry Saltz
4341,art   ,Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.,Jerry Saltz
4342,art ,The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter  surface  color  composition  touch  scale  form  or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.,Jerry Saltz
4343,art  ,Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz  and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However  I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public  out in the open.,Jerry Saltz
4344,art   ,Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery  works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.,Jerry Saltz
4345,art   ,Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces  questions what an object is  wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.,Jerry Saltz
4346,art   ,Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly  decisively  for good.,Jerry Saltz
4347,art   ,The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly  seeing things over and over  better than I've ever seen them before.,Jerry Saltz
4348,art  ,If the Frieze Art Fair catches on  I imagine at least two great things happening. First  we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly  Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.,Jerry Saltz
4349,art  ,Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still  over the past decade  its audience has hugely grown  and that's irked those outside the art world  who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.,Jerry Saltz
4350,art  ,I often find myself privately stewing about much British art  thinking that except for their tremendous gardens  that the English are not primarily visual artists  and are  in nearly unsurpassable ways  literary.,Jerry Saltz
4351,art   ,A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms  'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.,Jerry Saltz
4352,art   ,I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices  and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.,Jerry Saltz
4353,art  ,I love art dealers. In some ways  they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is  create their own aesthetic universes  support artists  employ people  and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.,Jerry Saltz
4354,art  ,When museums are built these days  architects  directors  and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties  eat dinner  wine-and-dine donors. Sure  these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.,Jerry Saltz
4355,art  ,I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week  and no matter what kind of mood I'm in  no matter how bad the art is  I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.,Jerry Saltz
4356,art  ,Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest  best  or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful  wicked  lovable  and annoying creatures known as art dealers).,Jerry Saltz
4357,art   ,Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.,Jerry Saltz
4358,art   ,Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.,Jerry Saltz
4359,art   ,We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave  and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.,Jerry Saltz
4360,art   ,Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.,Jean Cocteau
4361,art   ,I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.,Jean-Michel Basquiat
4362,art   ,To play safe  I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash  the triumph of magic over the brute.,Vladimir Nabokov
